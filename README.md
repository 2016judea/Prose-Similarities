# Prose-Similarities
This program takes novels and draws comparisons using NLP (specifically commonly used adjectives). The similarities between novels are used as edge weights in an undirected graph. We then run Dijkstra's algorithm on the graph to find shortest paths to establish authors with the most similar prose.
